		<p>The Death Ray is a charge-based laser weapon found on numerous official maps. When firing, the beam will pass through any object and any type of <a href="WAGNUS.html">Block</a> after its short charge time. The current charge of the gun is indicated on the side of the gun, as a red chamber that fills up, in addition to a noise. If the player releases the charge key, the built up charge will not be lost instantly, but slowly drop back down. This allows for the charge to be somewhat preserved by repeatedly holding the fire key, which can be useful in certain scenarios. When a player is hit by the beam, they are instantly roasted and turned into a <a href="WAGNUS.html">Cooked Duck</a>. <br> <br> The Death Ray has a considerable amount of knockback that can be used to traverse large distances. </p>
