		<p>The Grenade is a common weapon found on many maps. After pulling the pin, a player has 4 seconds before the Grenade explodes, and a player may hold onto it to "cook" it in order to define the range at which they want it to explode. Grenades explode into fragments that span a 5 block radius - if one of them hits a player, that player dies. Grenade's lose their pins when bouncing off a spring. <br> <br> A player can survive an explosion by having their entire body behind certain <a href="WAGNUS.html">Blocks</a> as well as throwing it up to minimize the area of the player's hitbox as the shrapnel expands around them, potentially killing nearby ducks. Wearing <a href="WAGNUS.html">Armor</a> or a <a href="WAGNUS.html">Helmet</a> and having a fragment strike the armor will stop a single fragment as well as boost the player away from the Grenade. <a href="WAGNUS.html">Shoes</a> do not stop fragments. It is possible to completely avoid an explosion if the affected is lucky. </p>
